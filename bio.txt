Some things to maybe add to my bio:

Short and to the point
Who you are, what makes you unique and how to contact and why you're qualified
Think about who your audience is
Start with a strong first sentence
Tell a compelling story maybe about what makes you different and unique
Include a call to action
Wrap it up with personality
